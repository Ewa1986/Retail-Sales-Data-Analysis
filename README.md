## Dataset Content

Historical sales data for 45 stores located in different regions - each store contains a number of departments. The    
Data from the Excel sheets (Stores, Features, Sales) downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manjeetsingh/retaildataset/data .


## Business Requirements
 
Analyse retail sales data to identify trends, insights, and the impact of promotional markdowns on sales. 
Provide comprehensive, visually appealing sales reports and insights to assist in strategic decision-making.


## Hypothesis and how to validate?

* Bigger shops generates more sales - check using Data Visualisation
* Majority of sales are happening over non-holidays weeks - check using Data Visualisation
* There is a massive pick in a sales over Christmas period - check using Data Visualisation
* All the shops (Type A, B and C) are experiencing pick time over the Christmas - check using Data Visualisation
* Markdowns during non - holidays weeks has smaller impact on sales rather than during holidays - check using Data Visualisation

## Project Plan
1. Downloading data set
2. ETL Pipeline: Extract, Transform and Load
3. Suggesting hypothesis
4. Data Visualisation: Descriptive Statistics, Trend Analysis, Impact Analysis & Comprehensive Analysis
5. Concluding 

I decided to use data visualisation as clear visual representation aids in better decision-making. 

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations

* Pinpoint which stores generate the highest weekly sales - Average Weekly Sales per Store and Department (bar chart)
* Detect seasonal trends and cyclic pattern in sales - Average sales trend by type (line chart)
* Examine if larger stores drive higher sales - Correlation between store size and weekly sales (scatter chart)


## Analysis techniques used


* List the data analysis methods used and explain limitations or alternative approaches.
* How did you structure the data analysis techniques. Justify your response.
* Did the data limit you, and did you use an alternative approach to meet these challenges?
* How did you use generative AI tools to help with ideation, design thinking and code optimisation?

## Ethical considerations
* Analysed data set didn't include sensitive information like names, contact details, purchase history therfore there was no ethical consideration involved. 
* There was no legal or social concerns as well. 

## Unfixed Bugs
* I didn't leave any unfixed bugs, but unfortunately I coudn't fully utlised plotly as my laptop has insufficient RAM. One of plots generated by me was causing gitpod website to crash and subsequently I had to delete it plot and use instead Matplotlib in my project. 

I recognised that I have limited knowledge about gitpod and to address that I visited LMS platform and I watched few videos on youtube about the platform.

## Development Roadmap
* What challenges did you face, and what strategies were used to overcome these challenges?
* What new skills or tools do you plan to learn next based on your project experience? 

## Main Data Analysis Libraries
* pandas
* numpy
* plotly.express
* plotly.graph_objects as go imported but not used as my laptop crashed while I used it
* seaborn
* matplotlib
